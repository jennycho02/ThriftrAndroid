Thriftr is an Android app to provide a mobile marketplace for college students who deal with the stresses of moving out/in every year. The ability 
to sell quickly and easily without having to rely on other forms of social media marketplaces that can get overwhelmed by listings not relevant. 
Google Maps API was utilized to allow clickable listings to show on a map of surrounding area.
